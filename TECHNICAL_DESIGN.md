# Technical Design Document: Path of Exile Latency Checker

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GUI Layer (`LatencyChecker` class)**
   - Manages the main application window and UI components
   - Handles user interactions and event processing
   - Implements the observer pattern for UI updates

2. **Network Layer**
   - Handles ping operations using system commands
   - Platform-independent implementation (Windows/Unix)
   - Asynchronous operation through threading

3. **Data Management**
   - In-memory storage of server information
   - Real-time statistics calculation
   - Thread-safe data updates

## Implementation Details

### Threading Model

1. **Main Thread**
   - Runs the tkinter event loop
   - Handles UI updates
   - Processes user input

2. **Worker Threads**
   - Managed by ThreadPoolExecutor
   - Execute ping operations
   - Number of threads = CPU cores - 1
   - Thread-safe communication via queue

### Data Flow

1. **User Input → Network Operations**
   - Button click triggers server check
   - Creates worker threads for ping operations
   - Results queued for UI updates

2. **Network Results → UI Updates**
   - Worker threads complete ping operations
   - Results posted to main thread
   - UI updated via tkinter's thread-safe methods

### Error Handling Strategy

1. **Network Errors**
   - Timeout handling
   - Connection failures
   - DNS resolution issues
   - Graceful degradation with error reporting

2. **Thread Management**
   - Proper thread cleanup
   - Resource deallocation
   - Deadlock prevention

3. **UI Error Handling**
   - Exception catching in event handlers
   - User feedback through log window
   - Graceful state recovery

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Thread Pool Management**
   - Dynamic thread count based on system capabilities
   - Efficient thread reuse
   - Controlled resource consumption

2. **UI Responsiveness**
   - Asynchronous operations for long-running tasks
   - Batch updates for UI elements
   - Efficient event handling

3. **Memory Management**
   - Proper cleanup of thread resources
   - Efficient data structures
   - Minimal state storage

### Scalability

1. **Server List Management**
   - Extensible server configuration
   - Easy addition of new servers
   - Dynamic server status updates

2. **Resource Usage**
   - Controlled thread creation
   - Efficient memory utilization
   - Minimal CPU overhead

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Areas

1. **Network Operations**
